# NewsMonkey

**NewsMonkey** is a modern React application bootstrapped with **Create React App**. It provides a ready-to-run starter app for fetching and viewing news in the browser.

## Available Scripts

These scripts are available in the project directory:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The app will reload automatically as you make edits. Lint errors (if any) will appear in the developer console.

---

### `npm test`
Launches the interactive test runner in watch mode.  
Learn more about testing in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

---

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing and minifying the code for best performance.

---

### `npm run eject`
⚠️ **Caution:** This is a one-way operation.  
It will copy all build dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control—but you cannot undo the process.
